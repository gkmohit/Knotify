                     Knotify collects information in order to provide our Service to Users, enabling them to efficiently share information and manage their communities online. We collect information in several ways:
                     <ul>
                        <li>Information initially collected from building managers. When a new community signs up with Knotify, resident information is provided such as name, mailing address, phone number, email address and other public information the resident has provided to their community administrators (i.e. developer, property manager, strata council, board of directors or homeowners association).</li>
                        <li>Information from residents. When residents sign in they may have the option to provide additional information about themselves and their home, with privacy controls in place to manage what is shared with community administrators.</li>
                        <li>Information added by community administrators. Community administrators have the ability to upload and store community documents and information for community management purposes. These documents and information are securely maintained and protected against unauthorized access.</li>
